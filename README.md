# Sentiment Analysis

This project is focused on performing sentiment analysis for the cryptocurrency bitcoin, but can easily be expanded to other coins. Currently it only gathers data from Twitter.

## Justification:

Cryptocurrencies have been on the rise for the past years. Its value is completely defined by speculation of how much they can be worth. As such their exchange rates are very volatile, and very unpredictable.

Twitter is one of the most popular social media networks there is, and its an outlet though which millions of people broadcast their thoughts, fears and opinions on any topic of their interest.

The goal of this project is to determine if we analyze this publicly available data to develop cryto trading strategies or algorithms that are profitable.
